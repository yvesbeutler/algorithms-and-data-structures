/**
 * @author yvesbeutler
 * Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm which is based on partitioning arrays of data
 * into two smaller arrays which are less and greater than a specific value called pivot. The
 * pivot can be randomly chosen, mostly it's the first, last or the middle element of an array.
 * Quicksort is called recursively on its subarrays and is quite efficient for large datasets
 * with an average complexity of O(n log(n)). Worst case is if the pivot will be the smallest
 * or largest element of the array, so that one subarray has the length of zero. Then its
 * complexity can as slow as O(n^2).
