### Basic structure

The Tree represents its nodes connected by edges. There's a root node at the top of the structure and several
child nodes, which can also be parents of an other amount of children. A special variation of a Tree is a Binary
Tree. These Trees combine the benefits of quick searching and fast insertion & deletion of the Array and the Linked
List.

### Terms

**Path**: Sequence of nodes which ends on top at the root.

**Root**: Highest node which has no parent node.

**Parent**: Every node except the root has one edge to an upper node called parent.

**Child**: Every node has one or two edges to a node below called child.

**Leaf**: A node which has no child nodes is called a leaf node.
