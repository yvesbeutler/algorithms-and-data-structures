### Basic structure

A Linked List is a sequence of data structures which are connected together via links. Each of these
items called Nodes store an object and a link to the next Node in the List. There are three types of
Linked Lists: The Simple-, Doubly- and the Circular Linked List. You can only navigate top-down on the
Simple Linked List and both ways on the Doubly Linked List. The Doubly Linked List contains a link to
the previous Node in addition to the next Node link. The Circular Linked List doesn't end so the last
Node's next link is pointing to the first Node again.

### Basic operations

There are several basic operations you can process with a Linked List:
- Insertion (add an element at the beginning or at the end)
- Delete (remove an element at the beginning or at the end)
- Display (show the whole Linked List content)
- Search (look up for a specific element on the List)
