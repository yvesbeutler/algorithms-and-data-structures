### Description

This repository represents all kinds of algorithms and data structures I've come across during my bachelor degree at
the Bern University of Applied Sciences.

### Project Structure

The application structure presented in this repository is divided by its type. All data structures are separated from
other code like sorting algorithms. Please note, that there is a documentation about every used algorithm in the
docs folder.
