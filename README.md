### Description

This repository represents all kinds of algorithms and data structures I've come across during my bachelor degree at
the Bern University of Applied Sciences.

### Project Structure

The application structure presented in this repository is divided by its type. All data structures are separated from other code like sorting algorithms. Please note, that there is a documentation about every used data structure in the docs folder.

```
.
├── docs                     # Documentation of all used data structures
├── src                      # All source code

│   └── sorting              # Sorting algorithms
